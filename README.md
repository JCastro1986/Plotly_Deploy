### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is using JS scripts to gatther data from a json file.
I will later use Plotly to show different with graphs the information of the Dataset.
I will identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons

I will be able to select User considering their individual's ID from the dropdown menu to show the information.
The Script filters the json information and feeds graphs values.
